Manuscript: Geographic biases and gaps in the sampling of plant–pollinator networks

README for analysis code

Overview

This repository contains the code and data-processing pipeline used in the manuscript “Geographic biases and gaps in the sampling of plant–pollinator networks.” The workflow use multiple country-level datasets, constructs analysis-ready variables, fits statistical models to explain spatial patterns in network sampling and reuse, and produces the figures and tables used in the manuscript.
